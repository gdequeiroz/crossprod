Summary: What size of underwear would you donate?

The Wellington Cathedral of St Paul (in New Zealand) has this newsletter item:

> **Whanganui Floods** 
> 
> In response to the recent floods that have devastated
> parts of the Whanganui district, [someone] from the Parish of
> Eastern Whanganui is collecting NEW unides/knickers.  That's right - undies!
> These will be distributed to families in need in the region.  All shapes,
> sizes and colours will be gratefully accepted.

What size of underwear ought donors to donate?  A few options come to
mind.

1.  Their own size.
2.  The size of someone they know in Wanganui.
3.  A random sample from a shop where they live (around Wellington).
4.  A random sample of a shop in Wanganui.

Choosing your own size is an easy stragegy to implement, but it only works under
certain assumption.  Are the donors of underwear similar in weight and balance
of sexes to the receivers?  Does anyone have access to demographics of New
Zealand Anglican parishes?

Choosing the size of someone one knows in Wanganui has a couple of advantages
over the first strategy.  First, parisoners of Wellington Cathedral may well
know parishoners of Eastern Whanganui.  Supposing the receivers of undies are
from all of Whanganui, not just the parishioners, it is still likely that people
know people.  This is a small country.

Secondly, donors may also know children in Wanganui, whereas they probably
aren't children themselves.  This is an important point for the third strategy:
sampling from a shop in Wellington.  [Bendon Lingerie](www.bendonlingerie.co.nz)
surely doesn't stock children's sizes.

The final strategy might be best, since a clothes shop in Wanganui probably
understands the local market as well as anyone.  But I'd be concerned for people
in the tails of the undie-size distribution.  The people in extreme need are the
people at the extremes.  Since too-small undies can usually stretch, a good
strategy would tends to under- rather than over-stimate the size of the
population.  Overestimates are useless -- the dungers fall down.
