## Simmer vs SimPy

The `simmer` package is a relatively new R package for discrete event simulation
(DES).  It is an exciting development, because there isn't a lot of open-source
DES software.  One popular tool is the Python 2 library `SimPy`, written by a
professor at my alma mater, Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand,
and later redeveloped for Python 3.

* Ports the code of the main `SimPy` tutorial 'The Bank' to `simmer`.
* Comments on some differences between the libraries.
